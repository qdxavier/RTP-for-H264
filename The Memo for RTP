NALs store into a file used for byte-stream format, and NALs for RTP is used packet-transport protocol. byte-stream format need to
be add 0x000001 or 0x00000001 at the start of the NALs for distinguishing the other NALs.

IDR: instantaneous decoding refresh

IDR picture: A coded picutre containing only slices with I or SI slice types that causes a "reset" in the decoding process.
             After the decoding of an IDR picture, all following coded pictures in decoding order can be decoded without 
             inter prediction(帧间预测) from any picture decoded prior to the IDR picture.
             
redundant coded picture: The content of a redundant coded picture shall not be used by the decoding process for a bitstream
                         conforming to H.264. The content of a redundant coded picuture may be used by the decoding process
                         for a bitstream that contains errors or losses.

decoding order number(DON): A field in the payload structure or a derived variable indicating NAL unit decoding order. Values of
                            DON are in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. After reaching the maximum value, the value of DON 
                            wraps around to 0.
                            
NALU-time: The value that the RTP timestamp would have if the NAL unit would be transported in its own RTP packet.

transmission order: The order of packets in ascending RTP sequence number order. Within an aggregation packet
                    (一幅图片的slice在多个包里面进行传输), the NAL unit transmission order is the same as the order of appearance
                    NAL units in the packet.

RTP header:

              contributing source(CSRC) identifier
              
              
Version(V): 2 bits 
            this field identifies the version of RTP.
padding(P): 1 bit
            If the padding bit is set, the packet contains one or more additional padding octets at the end.
extension(X): 1 bit
            If the extension bit is set, the fixed header MUST be followed by exactly one header extension.
CSRC count(CC): 4 bits
            The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers that follow the fixed header.
marker(M): 1 bit
            The interpretation of the marker is defined by a profile. It is intended to allow significant events such as
            frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream.
payload type(PT): 7 bits
            for H.264 video stream, used in a dynamic way.
            
sequence number(SN): 16 bits
            for the single NALU and non-interleaved packetization mode, the sequence number is used to determine decoding order
            for the NALU. The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent, and may be used receiver to detect
            packet loss and to restore packet sequence. The initial value should be random.
timestamp:  32 bits
            The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the content. A 90 kHZ clock rate MUST be used.
